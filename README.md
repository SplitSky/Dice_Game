# Dice_Game
This is a code solution to a game which involved tiles and two dice.
The tiles range from 1 to 9 in integer incremenets. The tiles can be flipped up or down.
A roll of two dice is made. The number is added. It is between 2 and 12. Then the corresponding value has to be made
from the tiles. If 6 is rolled the tiles 1,2,3 have to be flipped or 4,2 or 5,1. This brings in a question. What is the best
method to playing this game?
If a player can't make the number in consecutive turns then their turn is ended and the total number of tiles up is recorded. The player
with the lowest number of points wins.
